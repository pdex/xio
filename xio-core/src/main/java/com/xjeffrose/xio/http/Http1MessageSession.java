// Scenarios
// 1: client sends all of request before we respond
// 2: client sends request1 and request2 before we respond (http pipelining)
// 3: client sends part of request, we respond in full, client sends the rest of the request
// 4: client sends part of the request, we respond in full, client sends nothing (need timeout to
// detect)
